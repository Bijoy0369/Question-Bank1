If the multiple values to be returned are of same type, then the array of these values can be returned. But it is to be noted that the array should be either declared as static or should be dynamically allocated so that they donâ€™t get destroyed when the function ends.

This method is technically not for returning but writing the result of the function in the address (pointers) already passed as parameters. It is an alternative to returning structures or arrays.
